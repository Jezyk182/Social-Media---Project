WHOLE PROJECT ON MASTER BRANCH


Set Up:
The set up is a bit rough, but here are steps:
- After pull request, install all packeges by typing "npm i"
- To run backend, you need PostgreSQL installed with database and tables
- To connect database to backend, you need to create file inside BackEnd folder with name ".env"
- Data to pass into the file should contain postgress, database and any secret word (no matter what it is)
- To run Backend simply type "nodemo server.js"
- to run FrontEnd simply type "npm run dev"
- To check application usage, create account (everything is created locally), log in, create post and that's it!
